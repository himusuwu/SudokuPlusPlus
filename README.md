## About the Project

This project was born out of a desire to combine algorithmic problem-solving with graphical programming. The goal was to build a **complete Sudoku game** — not just a solver, but a full pipeline that:

1. **Generates** a valid, fully-filled 9×9 Sudoku grid.
2. **Shuffles** the board using row/column/band permutations to create variety.
3. **Removes cells** according to a chosen difficulty profile while ensuring the puzzle has **exactly one unique solution**.
4. **Presents** the puzzle in an interactive GUI where the player can select cells, enter numbers, and get real-time feedback.

It's a great exercise in backtracking algorithms, constraint satisfaction, and rendering with a lightweight C library.

## Features

- Interactive GUI built with Raylib
- Four difficulty levels: **Easy**, **Medium**, **Hard**, **Expert**
- Backtracking solver that guarantees a unique solution
- Board shuffling for maximum puzzle variety
- Real-time error checking and score tracking
- Built-in timer
- Mouse + keyboard input

## Built With

| Technology | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **C++20** | Core language |
| **Raylib 5.5** | 2D graphics & input handling |
| **CMake 3.16+** | Build system |
| **FetchContent** | Automatic Raylib dependency download |

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A C++20-compatible compiler (GCC 10+, Clang 12+, or MSVC 2019+)
- CMake **3.16** or newer
- Git
- On Linux you may need additional packages for Raylib:
  ```bash
  # Debian / Ubuntu
  sudo apt install libgl1-mesa-dev libx11-dev libxrandr-dev libxi-dev libxcursor-dev libxinerama-dev
  ```

### Installation

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/himusuwu/SudokuSolver.git
cd SudokuSolver

# 2. Create a build directory and configure
mkdir -p build && cd build
cmake ..

# 3. Build the project
make -j$(nproc)        # Linux / macOS
# or: cmake --build .  # cross-platform alternative
```

> **Note:** Raylib is fetched automatically by CMake during the configure step — no manual installation needed.

### Running

```bash
# From the build/ directory:
make run
# or run the binary directly:
./SudokuSolver
```

## ⚙ How It Works

```
Grid → Shuffle → Generate (remove cells) → Solve (verify uniqueness) → GUI
```

1. **`Grid`** — creates a valid base 9×9 Sudoku board.
2. **`Shuffler`** — randomly permutes rows, columns, and bands to diversify the board.
3. **`Generate`** — removes cells based on the selected `DifficultyProfile` (min/max empty cells, symmetry, solver attempts).
4. **`Solver`** — uses backtracking to verify the puzzle has exactly one solution (`check_unique`).
5. **`Game`** — renders the board via Raylib, handles user input, tracks errors, score, and time.
